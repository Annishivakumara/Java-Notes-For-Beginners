* Each method does not maintain its saparate copy of reference to store the values
* in call by reference mechanism the address of the actual parameter is passed to the function as the formal parameter
* Both the actual & formal  parameter refer to the some loacations 
* any changes made insie are actually reflected in the actual parameter of the caller
