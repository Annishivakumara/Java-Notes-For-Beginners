✅ Here’s What You Should Do (Step-by-Step)
🌱 Phase 1: Understand the Core Concept First (No Coding Yet)
Learn the key ideas behind Spring.
🔹 Just read and understand these:

Concept	What it means (in simple words)
IoC	Spring manages object creation — not you manually.
DI	Spring injects one class into another automatically.
Beans	Java objects created and managed by Spring.
Spring Container	The engine that holds and wires all beans together.

📌 Tip: Watch a short YouTube video or diagram after reading. Visuals help a lot!

⚙️ Phase 2: Choose ONE Learning Path
You have two ways to start learning Spring. Choose one:

Option A	Option B
🌿 Start with Spring Core	⚡ Jump directly to Spring Boot
Understand internals deeply	Focus on modern app building fast
Write XML / Java configs	Use annotations like @Component
Slower but deeper understanding	Faster results, good for web apps

Since you already know Dependency Injection, I recommend:

✅ Start with Spring Boot directly
It's faster, easier, and widely used in real projects.

🧪 Phase 3: Build a Simple App (Hands-on Learning)
You learn best by building, so I’ll guide you through:

Create a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr

Build a simple REST API (like Music Player or Calculator)

Use @Component, @Autowired, and @RestController
